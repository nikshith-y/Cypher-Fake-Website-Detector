# Cypher-Fake-Website-Detector
An AI-based browser extension for detecting fake websites by analyzing URLs and metadata.


PROBLEM STATEMENT: PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS 

PROBLEM: Nowadays fake and malicious websites are becoming a critical challenge in cybersecurity. These things include sharing sensitive information, scams and financial loss. We're working on detecting fake websites and malware by making a fake website detector.
The cybercriminals continuously update their methods creating new phishing tactics and website designs which are harder to identify with traditional detection tools. Many of the users lack the technical knowledge to recognize fake websites, making them more susceptible to fraud. The current detection methods such as blacklisting and URL checking are working more efficiently than the traditional methods.

Example:
Real website: https://www.flipkart.com/login
Fake website: http://flipkart-verification-secure.com/login

SOLUTION: To address the growing threat of fake websites, an AI-powered detection system provides an effective and scalable solution. This system can analyze various characteristics of websites and accurately classify them as fake in real world, key aspects of AI based solution mainly includes URL Analysis i.e. AI can analyze URL structures for suspicious patterns such as misspelled words, excessive characters or unusual domain names which are common in phishing sites.

We're trying to design this solution as Web Extension: 
The extension is enabled after opening the web browser. It checks each and every website that the user opens. After scanning the URL the user types, a pop up appears at bottom, it shows scanning status of the website(like safe, unsafe, unable to determine).
